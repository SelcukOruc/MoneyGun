Clone Of Mechanics Of MoneyGun Hyper-Casual Game
Hi, this is my first game cloning project. Before begining this project i tried to learn what elements i should meticulously inspect 
while cloning hyper-casual games by speaking directly to the people from sector. After getting suggestions and recomendations i took up this project.
I, particularly, focused on making assets that can be used with little bit modification or directly for upcoming projects in order to increase efficience. 
However, mostly because of my exams i had to keep developing in my freetime which was limited. Therefore, some assets; still, need some fixations (for example prop).


My plans for next projects;
is to learn and use DoTween to be more productive in shorter times.
Using Unity version control and working with people.
Improving myself in keeping up with trends.


Thanks for your time, i wish this project can be helpful in yours. If you need you can use my assets both for commercial or non-commercial purposes, 
no problem at all.
